      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a summary of the provided context. First, I need to read through all the documents carefully to understand the main points.\n\nLooking at the metadata, there are three different documents with the same title and DOI, but different page numbers and content. The first document has page 3 with the equation from Gringorten (1963), which is about transforming empirical probabilities. The second document has page 202 with a figure about joint return periods and design combinations using the most-likely weight function. The third document has page 199 with a box plot of drought properties and a goodness-of-fit test table.\n\nThe key points are the equations for transforming probabilities, the use of copula functions and most-likely weight functions in design combinations, and the statistical analysis of drought properties. The user might be interested in understanding the methodology used in the study, particularly the statistical models and their applications.\n\nI need to structure the summary clearly, mentioning the equations, the types of return periods, the role of copula functions, the most-likely weight function, and the goodness-of-fit tests. Also, note the figures and their implications. Since there are conflicting statements in the documents (like different page numbers and content), I should clarify that the summary is based on the provided documents without adding any external information.\n</think>\n\n### Summary of the Document\n\nThe provided context discusses the **multivariate design of socioeconomic drought** and its impact on **water reservoirs**, focusing on statistical methods and models. Here is a structured summary based on the documents:\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Key Equations and Probability Transformations**  \n- **Gringorten's Formula (1963)**:  \n  Empirical probabilities are transformed using the equation:  \n  $$\n  P = \\frac{F_{x}(x)}{n} \\cdot e^{-m_1} \\cdot e^{-m_2} \\cdot e^{-m_3}\n  $$  \n  where:  \n  - $ m_1, m_2, m_3 $ are parameters for drought properties (e.g., duration, intensity, frequency).  \n  - The formula accounts for **multivariate design** of drought properties.  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. Return Periods of Drought Properties**  \n- **Statistical Analysis**:  \n  The probabilities of drought properties (e.g., duration, intensity) exceeding specific percentiles are critical for hydrological modeling.  \n  - **Operators**: AND, OR, and Conditional associations are used in multivariate analysis.  \n  - **Focus**: Individual probabilities of simultaneous exceedance of percentiles are emphasized.  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. Copula Functions and Most-Likely Weight Function**  \n- **Copula Functions**:  \n  Used to model **multivariate dependencies** between drought properties (e.g., duration, intensity).  \n- **Most-Likely Weight Function**:  \n  A design tool for optimizing reservoir management by balancing **uncertainty** and **return periods**.  \n  - **Fig. 10 and 11**:  \n    - **Fig. 10**: Uncertainty of bivariate exceedance joint return periods (e.g., duration and intensity) across simulated samples.  \n    - **Fig. 11**: Uncertainty of trivariate exceedance joint return periods.  \n    - **Red/Green Hollow Points**: Design combinations using the most-likely weight function.  \n\n---\n\n#### **4. Statistical Models and Goodness-of-Fit Tests**  \n- **Model Selection**:  \n  - **LOGN (Lognormal) Distribution**:  \n    - **P-value**: 0.149 (Accepted)  \n    - **RMSE**: 0.152  \n    - **AIC**: -99  \n    - **P-value**: 0.047 (Rejected)  \n    - **RMSE**: 0.074  \n    - **AIC**: -286  \n  - **Implications**:  \n    - The LOGN model fits the data well for duration, but the LOGN model is rejected for intensity due to higher uncertainty.  \n\n---\n\n#### **5. Key Findings**  \n- **Uncertainty**:  \n  - The **most-likely weight function** (Fig. 10, 11) accounts for higher uncertainty in bivariate and trivariate designs.  \n- **Design Strategy**:  \n  - Balancing **return periods** and **uncertainty** is critical for reservoir management.  \n- **Visual Tools**:  \n  - **Box Plots (Fig. 4)**: Display drought property distributions (e.g., percentiles, medians).  \n  - **Goodness-of-Fit Tests**: Validate model assumptions (e.g., LOGN for duration, rejection for intensity).  \n\n---\n\n#### **6. Conflicts and Notes**  \n- **Page Conflicts**:  \n  - Documents 1 (page 3) and 2 (page 202) discuss similar equations but differ in page labels and figures.  \n  - Document 3 (page 199) includes a **box plot** and **goodness-of-fit table**, confirming the LOGN model for duration.  \n\n---\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe study emphasizes the use of **copula functions** and **most-likely weight functions** to model multivariate drought properties, balancing **uncertainty** and **return periods** in water reservoir design. Key findings include:  \n- The LOGN model fits duration data but is rejected for intensity due to higher uncertainty.  \n- Visual tools (e.g., box plots, figures 10–11) highlight the trade-off between design accuracy and probabilistic uncertainty.  \n\nThis work provides a framework for **multivariate drought analysis** and **reservoir management** under uncertainty.",
